# Shopify Node App Starter

This is a starter template for embedded shopify apps based on the [shopify cli node app](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-node).

Contributions to create the perfect shopify app boilerplate are very welcome! ðŸ¤©

## Changes to the default Shopify node app starter

- Updated dependencies (@apollo/client instead of react-apollo, react 17, next.js 12, polaris 7)
- MongoDB session storage already set up (full credit goes to [Harshdeep Singh Hura](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-mongodb-next-app))
- Ready to use online and offline accesstokens simultaneously
- App context set up. Can be used to store data, that only needs to be fetched once, but is needed in multiple places
- Link component to convert `<a>` tags to [Next Links](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) for relative paths
- Routepropagation set up
- Example API with `verifyRequest()` is set up
- Relay pagination example
- Webhook registration and persistance after server restart
- Examples for creating, displaying and canceling of app subscriptions
- Loading screen while the app context is loading

Boilerplate to create an embedded Shopify app made with Node, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Shopify-koa-auth](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/tree/master/packages/koa-shopify-auth), [Polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) and [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/tools/app-bridge/react-components).

## TODO

- GDPR webhooks

## Installation

- Fork and clone repo
- Create an app in the shopify partner dashboard
- Run `shopify app connect` to connect the app to shopify
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Add `ENCRYTION_STRING` and `MONGO_URL` to your `.env` file (.env example is in the root directory)
- Run `shopify app serve` to start dev enviroment

## Requirements

- If you donâ€™t have one, [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup).
- If you donâ€™t have one, [create a Development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) where you can install and test your app.
- In the Partner dashboard, [create a new app](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/tools/partner-dashboard/your-apps#create-a-new-app). Youâ€™ll need this appâ€™s API credentials during the setup process.

## Usage

Same usage as apps created with the [Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli)

## Important

API routes have to start with `/api/`. All relative paths starting with `/api/` will be converted to absolute paths by a [next.js rewrite](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites)
